planned features:
- lists, functional style

qol changes:
- add more test cases (positive and negative)
- allow underscore (why was this excluded to begin with)
- make semi-colons optional for returns (good for small anonymous functions)

bugs:
- parser will crash if the function ends in a comment
- currying does not work

chore:
- update grammar (changed function definition)
