Not sure what to call it, but it's a programming language.

[![tests](https://github.com/thomascpowell/lang/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thomascpowell/lang/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

## Features
- Minimal syntax with a functional paradigm
- Reasonably helpful error messages
- Not finished, probably still better than using Python

## Project Status
- Lexer: Complete
- Parser: Complete
- Interpreter: Planned

## Next Steps
- Write the interpreter
- Write a CLI + REPL
- Name the project (maybe)
