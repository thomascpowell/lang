An untitled/unfinished programming language.

[![tests](https://github.com/thomascpowell/lang/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thomascpowell/lang/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

## Features
- Minimal syntax with a functional paradigm
- Reasonably helpful error messages
- Not finished, probably still better than using Python

## Project Status
- Lexer, Parser: Complete
- Interpreter: WIP
- CLI: Planned

## Next Steps
- Finish the interpreter
- Write more code samples (see /demos)
- Come up with a name (biggest challenge)
